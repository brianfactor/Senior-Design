Senior Design Repository

EE 464D, Fall 2012/Spring 2013, 3D Modeler

Holds a build of KiwiViewer (used to view completed meshes on the phone)
KiwiViewer build instructions here: http://vtk.org/Wiki/VES/Download_And_Build_Instructions.
NOTES:
- Need latest version of CMake. For me, I had to manually download it.
- To compile if you're using the latest APK, need to change configure_ant.sh and instead run:
android update project --name KiwiViewer --path $app_dir --target android-17

Also now holds scripts to manage tasking on the linux server:
Taylor wrote up the framework for this, and a lot of the code was contributed from him.

Server Script usage:
# call this 12 times, after capturing left and right for each 30 deg angle
./s1_correlateImg left00.jpg right00.jpg pcout00.ply
# call this 11 times, for each pair of pointclouds
./s3_stichPCpair.sh pcout00.ply pcout01.ply pcstitch.ply
./s3_stichPCpair.sh pcout00.ply pcstitch.ply pcstitch.ply
# call this once, after stiching all perspectives
./s3_generateMesh.sh pcstitch.ply outputMesh.ply
