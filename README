Right now, this is just to hold apks I've compiled of other projects.

KiwiViewer build instructions here: http://vtk.org/Wiki/VES/Download_And_Build_Instructions.
NOTES:
- Need latest version of CMake. For me, I had to manually download it.
- To compile if you're using the latest APK, need to change configure_ant.sh and instead run:
android update project --name KiwiViewer --path $app_dir --target android-17
